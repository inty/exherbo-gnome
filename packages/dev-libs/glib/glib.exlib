SUMMARY="General purpose utility library"
DESCRIPTION="
GLib is a general-purpose utility library, which provides many useful data
types, macros, type conversions, string utilities, file utilities, a main loop
abstraction, and so on. It works on many UNIX-like platforms, Windows, OS/2 and
BeOS.  The general policy of GLib is that all functions are invisibly threadsafe
with the exception of data structure manipulation functions, where, if you have
two threads manipulating the same data structure, they must use a lock to
synchronize their operation.
